# D3Blocks

# Overview

- This project visualizes Gym & Personal activity data using the d3blocks Python library.
- The main goal is to create an interactive and dynamic "moving bubbles" visualization that represents different activities over time.

# Tech Stack

- Python: The primary programming language used for data processing and visualization.
- Pandas: For data manipulation and preprocessing.
- NumPy: Used for numerical operations and data generation.
- D3Blocks: A Python library that provides a simple interface for creating D3.js visualizations, used here to generate the moving bubbles visualization.
- Jupyter Notebook: For interactive development and visualization.

# Data

- The project utilizes a dataset with time series data, focusing on gym & personal activities. The data includes:

- datetime: The timestamp for each activity log.
- sample_id: A unique identifier for each activity instance.
- state: The type of activity.

# Visualizations

- Moving Bubbles Visualization:
- This visualization dynamically represents the different activities over time.
- The bubbles represent different activities, and their movement corresponds to the passage of time.
- The visualization adjusts its speed to provide insights at different levels: slow, medium, and fast.
